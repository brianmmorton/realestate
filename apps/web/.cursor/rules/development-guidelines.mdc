# High Level Development Guidelines

- ALWAYS separate components to reduce rerenders
- Use web/src/containers for large components shared across routes
- Use web/src/components ONLY for highly reusable components
- Implement code in web/src/pages unless there is a good reason to move the code to containers or components
- Always name files according to their export
- Always use named exports
- For forms, use zustand to manage state alongside selectors to reduce rerenders
- ALWAYS assume that npm run dev is running in a separate terminal outside of the IDE, so you should not start it. Instead, check typescript for compilation issues.
- Relay queries should be defined inline
- Always use fragments to retrieve data for a component
